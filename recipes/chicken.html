        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Chicken Teriyaki Over Rice</strong> is a 
            popular and simple dish that can be made quickly and
            at home with minimal ingredients. It is sour with a flare of
            sweet for those who have a sweet tooth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the recipe is so simple, you want to make sure that
            your ingredients are of high quality. Poorly picked Brocolli,
             or overcooked rice will really take away from the dish.

                 <l>egg</l>
                 <l>all-purpose flour</l>
                 <l>corn flour</l>
                 <l>water</l>
                 <l>4 cups of vegetable oil</l>
                 <l>teaspoon of salt</l>
                 <l>quarter teaspoon of black pepper</l>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <l>Place the chicken, half the salt, and all of the pepper in a blender or food processor and blend it on high until smooth.</l>
                <l>Get a large plate and put 1/4 cup of the corn flour on it. Empty the chicken mixture onto the plate and begin to form the shape of the nuggets, coating them in the corn flour.</l>

                <l>Mix the remaining 3/4 cup of corn flour, 1 cup of all-purpose flour, egg, remaining salt, and water together in a mixing bowl.</l>
                <l>Heat up the vegetable oil in a pot on medium to high heat. Once the oil is hot enough to fry the nuggets, get the chicken out of the freezer. </l>
                <l>Place one nugget at a time into the batter, and then transfer immediately into the oil. Fry for 7 minutes, or until golden brown.</l>
                <l>Repeat this process until all chicken nuggets have been cooked. </l>
